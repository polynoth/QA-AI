the system is built around a RockPi Single board computer running a stripped down version of debian linux. Lots of systemD services are disabled. The AI calculations are preformed by a google coral USB board. I trained a custom tenssorflow model using a transfer learning algorithm. The AI is started using some custom Shell scripts. Python was utilized as the programming language that acts as a glue to tie together all of the libraires and to call various command line tools while the program runs in a modified version of the i3 window manager. I modified an example that was included with the googleCoral development board in order to get up to speed quicker and save time. Any generic usb web cam will work with this setup although 1 megapixel is highly reccomended to maintain 30fps . All code requires python3.9. 
Here is a link to a video demo of the current iteration of the AI. https://youtu.be/-w2P2k2h8ts
